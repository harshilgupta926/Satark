# SATARK Sentinel
### Evidence-led incident investigation and AI-assisted digital threat triage

**Investigate the incident. Trace the evidence. Make the next decision with context.**

SATARK Sentinel is a security-awareness and incident-investigation prototype built around **FIRSTLIGHT Incident Command**. It combines a deterministic, evidence-linked investigation workflow with optional AI-assisted analysis of suspicious digital content. The goal is to help a person move from scattered signals to a structured, reviewable picture of what may have happened—without presenting an AI score as a verdict.

> **Prototype and safety boundary:** SATARK is a learning and triage aid, not an antivirus, certified forensic product, or proof that content is safe or malicious. FIRSTLIGHT uses synthetic incident data and simulated response actions. Its session-based audit chain is not independently anchored chain-of-custody evidence. Use synthetic or public, non-sensitive data in the current demo.

## 1. Executive summary

**SATARK Sentinel** is a browser-based security investigation prototype that connects two complementary capabilities:

1. **FIRSTLIGHT Incident Command — the primary experience:** a guided, repeatable investigation of a fictional account-compromise scenario, with evidence-integrity checks, deterministic rules, evidence-linked findings, a timeline, evidence gaps, and human approval controls for simulated response actions.
2. **SATARK threat triage — the supporting experience:** AI-assisted analysis of suspicious text, URLs, images, QR codes, PDFs, and supported videos, with local pattern-based signals and explainable next-step guidance.

The central design principle is to keep **observations, model interpretation, uncertainty, and response decisions distinct**. The system should help a person understand what the available evidence supports, what remains unknown, and what should be checked next.

**Current implementation:** a Python/Streamlit application with a Groq integration for supported AI workflows, a deterministic FIRSTLIGHT engine, bounded input-processing helpers, URL-fetching protections, report export, automated tests, and CI/CodeQL workflows.

## 2. The problem

People and small teams often encounter a mix of suspicious messages, links, QR codes, attachments, login alerts, and disconnected event records. The difficulty is not just detecting one suspicious item; it is understanding how separate signals relate, what is actually supported by evidence, and which response step is justified.

Common problems include:

- **Fragmented evidence:** clues arrive in different formats and at different times.
- **Over-trusting a score:** a risk number can look definitive even when evidence is incomplete.
- **Unclear reasoning:** users may not know which observable signal supports a finding.
- **Missing context:** a workflow may report a suspicious event without clearly showing what is still unknown.
- **Premature action:** a response can be initiated before a person has reviewed the available information.
- **Difficult learning:** security-awareness tools often teach isolated red flags rather than a structured investigation process.

SATARK Sentinel is designed as a prototype response to these workflow problems. It organizes evidence and review steps; it does not claim to replace security professionals, endpoint detection, or a production incident-response platform.

## 3. Our approach

The project follows an **evidence-first, human-reviewed workflow**:

1. **Collect** a synthetic incident scenario or a supported suspicious digital artifact.
2. **Validate and prepare** the input using format-specific limits and checks.
3. **Extract observable signals** with deterministic rules where applicable.
4. **Use AI as an assistant** for supported content-analysis workflows, not as the sole source of truth.
5. **Correlate and review** findings, timestamps, evidence references, and gaps.
6. **Decide with a human in the loop** using explicit approval/rejection controls in the FIRSTLIGHT simulation.
7. **Export or revisit** the resulting report or current-session history where supported.

The product keeps two modes clear: FIRSTLIGHT demonstrates an explainable, deterministic investigation workflow over synthetic data; the scanners help triage suspicious content and may use an external AI provider. These are related parts of one security workflow, but they have different trust and data-handling boundaries.

## 4. Flagship experience: FIRSTLIGHT Incident Command

FIRSTLIGHT is the main workspace and the best place to start a demonstration. It loads a fictional account-compromise scenario so the investigation can be explored without requiring a live attack, real account access, or sensitive incident evidence.

### Capabilities

- **Repeatable synthetic scenario:** explore a consistent incident story and its supporting artifacts.
- **SHA-256 integrity verification:** calculate and check hashes for supported evidence artifacts.
- **Tampering challenge:** demonstrate how changing an artifact can affect an integrity check.
- **Deterministic investigation workflow:** apply explicit rules to the available event/evidence data rather than relying on a language model to invent an incident narrative.
- **Evidence-linked findings:** connect findings to the available evidence references so a reviewer can inspect the basis for a conclusion.
- **Chronological timeline:** put normalized incident events into time order to make sequences easier to understand.
- **Evidence-gap reporting:** call out unanswered questions and missing corroboration rather than implying the investigation is complete.
- **Human review controls:** approve or reject proposed response steps within the simulation.
- **Hash-chained in-session audit trail:** demonstrate how ordered review events can be linked together and checked for tampering during the current session.
- **JSON export:** export supported investigation output for inspection or downstream prototyping.

### What FIRSTLIGHT does not do

FIRSTLIGHT does **not** disable a real account, terminate a process, isolate an endpoint, contact an identity provider, or perform a real network response. The response controls are a prototype simulation. The current audit chain is held in session and is not a durable, independently anchored log or a certified forensic chain of custody. Evidence integrity checks establish whether bytes match a computed hash; they do not establish where evidence came from or whether it is truthful.

See [FIRSTLIGHT scope and safety boundaries](docs/FIRSTLIGHT.md).

## 5. Supporting SATARK threat-analysis tools

The existing scanners remain available as supporting workflows.

| Workflow | What it supports | Important boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text analysis | Reviews pasted messages and text for suspicious patterns and requests an AI-assisted assessment when configured. | Model interpretation can be wrong or incomplete. |
| URL analysis | Validates a URL, safely fetches eligible public-page text, and assesses available content. | URL-fetch protections are defense in depth, not a substitute for host-level egress controls. |
| Image analysis | Sends supported image content for AI-assisted inspection. | Image analysis does not execute files or prove that an image is benign. |
| QR analysis | Extracts/inspects QR content through the supported image workflow. | A decoded destination still needs independent verification. |
| PDF analysis | Extracts supported PDF text and analyses it. | This is not a malware sandbox or exhaustive file scan. |
| Video analysis | Samples representative frames; audio transcription may be available when FFmpeg and provider support are present. | Frame sampling and optional transcription can miss important content. |
| Deterministic signal ledger | Shows local pattern-based observations such as urgency, credential requests, payment language, URL/shortener patterns, and phone/UPI-like identifiers where applicable. | A pattern match is a review signal, not proof of fraud. |
| Evidence coverage review | Highlights when a broad AI assessment lacks independent local text-rule observations and treats visual workflows separately. | It is a coverage check, not claim-by-claim verification of the model's response. |
| PDF report | Produces a downloadable report for a supported analysis. | A generated report is not a certified forensic report. |
| Session history | Allows results to be revisited within the current app session. | History is not durable case storage and may not survive a session restart. |
| Security learning | Includes Scam Challenge, SATARK Academy, and Classroom Mode. | Learning content is for awareness and practice, not professional certification. |

### Input limits and optional tools

Input handling applies format-specific bounds before processing. The configured Streamlit upload ceiling is 50 MB; PDF and image processing use stricter per-format limits. Video frame extraction uses OpenCV. Audio extraction/transcription from video additionally depends on FFmpeg being installed and the configured provider supporting the workflow. Exact supported behavior can depend on input format, installed dependencies, and provider availability.

## 6. Example demonstration flow

This is a suggested product walkthrough, not a claim that a real incident was detected.

1. **Open FIRSTLIGHT.** Introduce the fictional account-compromise scenario and its evidence artifacts.
2. **Verify integrity.** Show the SHA-256 check, then use the controlled tampering challenge to illustrate why integrity checks matter.
3. **Run the investigation.** Walk through deterministic findings and the evidence references associated with them.
4. **Inspect the timeline.** Explain how event ordering supports or weakens a possible sequence of events.
5. **Review the gaps.** Show which questions remain unanswered and why a reviewer should avoid overstating the conclusion.
6. **Review a simulated response.** Approve or reject a proposed action and show the resulting in-session audit events.
7. **Export the result.** Demonstrate the supported JSON export.
8. **Connect the supporting scanner.** Submit a harmless sample message or public, non-sensitive URL to SATARK's triage workflow; compare local signals with the AI interpretation and explain why neither should be treated as a verdict.

**Demo safety:** use only the built-in synthetic scenario and harmless/public, non-sensitive examples. Do not demonstrate using real credentials, OTPs, private keys, confidential incident evidence, or unauthorized targets.

## 7. What makes the approach different

The project's intended differentiators are workflow and transparency, not a claim of superior detection accuracy.

- **Evidence before narrative:** FIRSTLIGHT starts from available artifacts and deterministic rules, rather than asking an AI model to invent the incident sequence.
- **Visible uncertainty:** evidence gaps are part of the result, not hidden behind a single score.
- **Human approval in the loop:** response steps are explicitly reviewed in the simulation.
- **Integrity as a demonstrable concept:** SHA-256 verification and a tampering challenge make artifact-integrity concepts tangible.
- **Separate local signals from AI interpretation:** pattern observations and model output are presented as different kinds of evidence.
- **Multiple input types:** supporting scanners provide a single entry point for several common suspicious-content formats.
- **Safety-aware design:** bounded inputs, URL destination validation, redirect checks, normalized model results, and regression tests reduce specific classes of avoidable failures.
- **Accessible learning path:** the learning features provide an entry point for people building basic scam-awareness skills.

These are implementation goals and demonstrated prototype behaviors. The repository does not yet establish detection precision/recall, reduced incident-response time, production-scale performance, or superiority to commercial security tools; those claims would require measured evaluation.

### Main trust boundaries

1. **Browser to Streamlit:** browser/UI state is presentation state and is not trusted as durable evidence.
2. **Input to preprocessing:** uploaded and pasted content is subject to format-specific bounds and validation.
3. **Server to user-supplied URL:** URL retrieval is an SSRF-sensitive operation. The implementation validates eligible HTTP(S) destinations, checks DNS results, pins connections to validated IPs, revalidates redirects, blocks HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade redirects, and limits response size/type.
4. **Application to Groq:** prepared evidence may leave the application when the user explicitly starts a provider-backed AI analysis.
5. **Session state to persistence:** current history and FIRSTLIGHT audit events are session-scoped, not durable multi-user case storage.

### Processing flow for a scanner

1. User selects a workflow and supplies input.
2. The relevant input processor validates and bounds the content.
3. Supported local deterministic signals are extracted where applicable.
4. If the user requests AI analysis and a valid provider configuration is available, the prepared evidence is sent to Groq.
5. The result is parsed and normalized before it is shown.
6. The UI presents the result, relevant signals, limitations, and suggested next steps; supported reports can be exported.

### Processing flow for FIRSTLIGHT

1. Load the built-in fictional incident and its artifacts.
2. Verify supported evidence hashes and optionally demonstrate tampering.
3. Normalize and evaluate the scenario using deterministic investigation rules.
4. Generate findings with evidence references, timeline context, and explicit gaps.
5. Record human approval/rejection choices as simulated events in the current session.
6. Export supported investigation output as JSON.

More detail is available in [Architecture and threat model](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 9. Technology stack

| Technology | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Python | Core application, input processing, rules, orchestration, and tests |
| Streamlit | Web interface, navigation, and session state |
| Groq API | Optional AI-assisted text/vision workflows and supported transcription |
| pypdf | PDF text extraction |
| Pillow | Image loading and conversion |
| OpenCV | Video frame extraction |
| FFmpeg | Optional audio-track extraction for supported video transcription |
| ReportLab | PDF report generation |
| CSS | Responsive styling, visual hierarchy, subtle motion, and reduced-motion support |
| unittest | Automated unit and regression tests |
| GitHub Actions | CI checks and browser smoke/layout validation |
| CodeQL | Static security analysis workflow |

The application is primarily Python/Streamlit. Its styling uses a dedicated CSS layer and native Streamlit UI components rather than requiring a separate React application. Animations are restrained and support reduced-motion preferences.

Model availability and exact model choices are controlled by the configured provider and the model-selection code; provider availability, account access, rate limits, and model deprecations can change independently of this repository.

## 10. Run the project locally

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Git
- Dependencies in requirements.txt
- A Groq API key only if you want to exercise provider-backed workflows
- FFmpeg only if you want to test the optional video-audio transcription path

### Install

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/kaustubhdua/Satark.git
cd Satark
python -m venv .venv
~~~

Activate the environment:

**Windows PowerShell**

~~~powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
~~~

**macOS / Linux**

~~~bash
source .venv/bin/activate
~~~

Install dependencies and launch the app:

~~~bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run satark.py
~~~

Streamlit prints the local URL in the terminal. Open that address in your browser. The built-in FIRSTLIGHT scenario and offline sample are intended to make parts of the prototype explorable without live provider credentials.

## 11. Configure the AI provider

SATARK reads GROQ_API_KEY from Streamlit-managed secrets first and can fall back to the environment variable.

### Windows PowerShell

~~~powershell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your-key"
streamlit run satark.py
~~~

### macOS / Linux

~~~bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key"
streamlit run satark.py
~~~

### Streamlit Community Cloud

In the app's **Settings → Secrets**, add:

~~~toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "your-key"
~~~

Use your own key from the official [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/). Never commit secrets, paste them into issues, or place them in browser-visible code. Use the hosting platform's secret manager for deployed environments. If a key may have been exposed, revoke/rotate it.

**Privacy note:** provider-backed analysis may transmit the prepared input to Groq. Review provider data-handling terms and your own legal/privacy requirements before sending sensitive content. For the current hackathon demo, use synthetic or non-sensitive data.

## 12. Tests and engineering safeguards

Run the repository's local checks:

~~~bash
python -m pip check
python -m compileall -q .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
~~~

The test suite covers areas including:

- AI-provider configuration and model selection
- Analysis normalization and stable finding behavior
- FIRSTLIGHT investigation and evidence-ingestion rules
- Input-processing boundaries and safe error handling
- URL validation, redirect handling, and SSRF-related edge cases
- Evidence-coverage review behavior
- PDF report generation
- Video-processing helpers
- UI contracts and Scam Challenge behavior

GitHub Actions also runs dependency/compile/test checks, browser smoke and layout checks, asset/style/whitespace validation, and a CodeQL workflow. Consult the [CI workflow](https://github.com/kaustubhdua/Satark/actions/workflows/ci.yml) and [CodeQL workflow](https://github.com/kaustubhdua/Satark/actions/workflows/codeql.yml) for current run status.

**A passing test suite is evidence of the checks that ran, not proof of production readiness.** Live provider behavior, host configuration, external data handling, deployment revision, and manual device testing require separate verification. See the [release-readiness runbook](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md).

## 13. Security, privacy, and current limitations

### Current safeguards

- Input-processing paths use format-specific size and parsing limits.
- URL fetching rejects unsafe destinations, validates resolved addresses, pins connections, rechecks redirects, and restricts response types and size.
- AI results are normalized before display; the model is treated as an untrusted analyzer.
- User-facing error handling is designed not to expose raw provider payloads or secrets.
- API keys belong in environment variables or a host secret manager—not source control.
- CI and CodeQL provide repeatable checks for regressions.

### Known limitations and release gates

- **No verified authentication/authorization or tenant isolation:** do not use this deployment for confidential multi-user cases.
- **No durable case/evidence storage:** Streamlit session state is temporary and is not a case-management database.
- **No independently anchored evidence manifest:** a computed hash is useful for integrity comparison, but provenance and independent custody are separate questions.
- **Session-scoped audit chain:** FIRSTLIGHT's audit chain is a demonstration, not a durable tamper-evident enterprise audit service.
- **Process-local rate limiting:** the application limiter is not a distributed/global quota and cannot by itself control usage across replicas or restarts.
- **Hosting-level controls need verification:** request-body limits, concurrency, execution timeouts, egress restrictions, abuse controls, and cost ceilings must be verified at the deployment layer.
- **Live-provider checks need an authorized test key:** success, timeout, invalid key, unavailable model, malformed response, and rate-limit behavior require target-environment tests.
- **Detection quality has not been benchmarked:** precision, recall, false-positive rate, evidence-grounding quality, and latency require a defined dataset and repeatable evaluation.
- **Privacy and provider review remains necessary:** assess data processing/retention terms and provide appropriate notice, retention/deletion behavior, and incident ownership before handling real user data.
- **Not a malware sandbox or certified forensic platform:** the app does not execute suspicious files in an isolated environment or guarantee exhaustive inspection.

### Recommended use right now

Use SATARK Sentinel for **hackathon demonstration, supervised exploration, and synthetic/non-sensitive test inputs**, after checking the exact deployed revision. Do not use it as the sole basis for security decisions or for confidential, regulated, or real incident evidence.

See [Security policy](SECURITY.md), [Analysis limitations](docs/ANALYSIS_LIMITATIONS.md), [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), and [Release readiness](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md).

## 14. Roadmap

The following is a forward-looking roadmap, not a claim that every item is implemented.

### Near-term: demonstration quality and reliability
- [ ] Complete target-deployment smoke tests against the exact deployed commit.
- [ ] Test live provider success and failure modes using a dedicated, authorized test key.
- [ ] Expand adversarial tests for malformed/encrypted PDFs, image edge cases, video edge cases, and URL abuse cases.
- [ ] Keep the README, architecture notes, demo flow, and release sign-off aligned with the actual code.

### Next: stronger investigation workflow
- [ ] Design durable case and evidence storage with explicit retention/deletion behavior.
- [ ] Add authenticated access and authorization/tenant-isolation boundaries before multi-user sensitive use.
- [ ] Design independently verifiable evidence manifests and durable audit records.
- [ ] Add clear case lifecycle, export validation, and audit verification UX.
- [ ] Measure investigation usefulness with a repeatable synthetic dataset and human-reviewed rubric.

### Later: operational readiness
- [ ] Add deployment-level global quotas, concurrency controls, cost limits, monitoring, and alerting.
- [ ] Verify restrictive egress policy in the actual hosting environment.
- [ ] Document incident response, backup/restore, rollback, and ownership.
- [ ] Establish evaluation metrics for accuracy, false positives, grounding, latency, and robustness.
- [ ] Complete privacy/provider review before permitting sensitive evidence.

## 16. Hackathon-ready project summary

Use this section as a source for a pitch deck. Adapt it to the event's required format and only make claims the team can demonstrate.

### One-line description

**SATARK Sentinel is an evidence-first security investigation prototype that helps users structure a synthetic incident, inspect evidence-linked findings and gaps, and triage suspicious digital content with optional AI assistance.**

### Short abstract

Digital threats often arrive as disconnected messages, links, attachments, and event records. SATARK Sentinel combines FIRSTLIGHT Incident Command—a deterministic investigation workflow over a synthetic account-compromise scenario—with supporting AI-assisted scanners for suspicious text, URLs, images, QR codes, PDFs, and supported videos. It highlights observable signals, evidence references, timelines, and unanswered questions, while keeping human review central to simulated response decisions. The prototype is built with Python and Streamlit, uses Groq for supported AI workflows, and includes regression tests and automated CI checks. It is intended for awareness, demonstration, and triage—not as a replacement for professional incident response or a certified forensic system.

### Problem statement

Users need a clearer way to move from disconnected digital warning signs to an evidence-informed next step. A single risk score does not explain the evidence, its gaps, or the limits of a conclusion.

### Proposed solution

Provide a guided investigation workspace that links deterministic findings to available evidence, displays a timeline and evidence gaps, and lets a human review simulated response actions—alongside optional AI-assisted scanning of common suspicious-content formats.

### Key demo-able capabilities

- Synthetic account-compromise investigation in FIRSTLIGHT.
- SHA-256 evidence integrity check and controlled tampering demonstration.
- Deterministic evidence-linked findings and chronological timeline.
- Explicit evidence gaps and simulated human approval/rejection.
- In-session hash-chained audit demonstration and JSON export.
- Supporting text/URL/image/QR/PDF/video triage workflows.
- Local pattern signals separated from AI interpretation.
- PDF reporting, learning content, and automated regression checks.

### Target users and use cases

Potential audiences include students learning cyber safety, awareness trainers, hackathon evaluators, and teams exploring how to structure an initial triage workflow. Any real-world deployment would need appropriate access controls, data-handling review, operational safeguards, and validation first.

### Current status and honest claim boundary

The repository contains a working prototype and automated tests. The live application is available at the demo link above, but deployment revision and all provider-backed paths must be checked in the target environment before claiming a fully verified release. No measured detection benchmark, production multi-tenant security, durable evidence custody, or real response integration is claimed.

## 17. Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially focused improvements to reliability, accessibility, investigation clarity, and tests.

1. Keep changes focused and explain the behavior being changed.
2. Add regression tests for bug fixes and new behavior.
3. Run the local checks and report exactly which checks passed.
4. Never commit API keys, tokens, private incident evidence, or other sensitive data.
5. Report suspected vulnerabilities through the process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), rather than posting sensitive details publicly.
